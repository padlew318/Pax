				<p>Set in the centre of the pretty coastal fishing village of Portloe, Pax Place holiday cottage with its stunning view over Portloe Cove, cliff walks in both directions, nearby beaches, golf courses, fishing and sailing, good selection of eating places close by and many places to visit is an ideal spot for an enjoyable holiday in the centre of the charming village of Portloe for a weekend or longer for one or two adults.  Small well-behaved dog welcome. Regret no smokers.</p>
<p>
 Pax is beside a stream running into the harbour so there should be no reason not to sleep peacefully in the bedroom overlooking the Jacka and cliffs without being disturbed and being so close to the sea to take an early morning swim before setting off for the day.  </p>

				<p>Portloe is near St. Mawes on the south coast at the end of a lane nestled in a valley hidden with trees overhead which winds its way down to the sea and Portloe Cove and its breakwater providing shelter for fishing boats and rocks and a beach to swim from.</p>
